# Version 5.1-9

There are two things need fixing

- the cdf function is not working for discrete distribution with varying truncation 

- I would like to see how we can dump the function generated by `gen.trun()` into or global environment or ther names space of 

- the pdf and cdf generating functions `trun.d()` and `trun.p()`  give now a values of zero outside the range of the response.

- the `name` option in `gen.trun()` and `trun()` function it has been changed to `extra.name`.
